Chapter 4 to 6
Django is a completely new terrain for me as I said earlier. The challenges I faced are numerous. Do everything I should have done only to realize there are errors when I compiled are simply most inconveniencing. There are days I get stuck with indentation of "else" statement that will not allow my code to compile.
